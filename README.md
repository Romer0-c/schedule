Welcome to your new daily calendar!

# To Use

easy functionality helps the user keep track of their daily schedule. 
Enter the task at hand for the applicable hour and hit the save button. 

During the day the schedule will display different colours based on the time of day. 

If the hour is past, the slot will be grey.
If the hour is current, the slot will be red.
If the hour is in the future, the slot will be green. 

This helps the user prioritize their tasks and stay on track!
